This project was born from a Web Programming course I took at Harvard Summer 2018 and it turned into an incredible project that I worked on for the next 4 years. These tournaments were intended for K-12 students and I had participated in them frequently while growing up. One issue they all faced was that they all used different systems for organizing tournaments. I built TXMC to provide a single unified system to organize all parts of these Math & Science Tournaments. It handles registrations, payments, notifications, & real-time results and it was successfully used for hosting 4 in-person tournaments before COVID hit. During Summer 2020, I decided to redesign my web application to work for virtual tournaments. As a part of that endeavor, I also created a Math Test Generator to rapidly produce tests for these virtual tournaments. Over the next 2 years, I hosted over 60 weekly virtual tournaments, engaged over 2000+ students from Texas, and I used the proceeds to pay for my college tuition. The project has since been retired due to spam but the code is public!",

I created a basic implementation of X11 for DOOM - including mouse/keyboard event queueing and framebuffer manipulation. In about 20 hours of work I also individually developed a desktop environment for the OS, with support for colors, shapes, text, images, and a mouse/keyboard controlled cursor. It wasn't easy though. If you've ever looked into the structure of font & image files you would know that's an impossible task for a single person. So I came up with a workaround - I used Java to read the data for fonts/images and converted them to a custom file format that I could process in C for the desktop environment. It was a massive success and I'm very proud of the work I did. Check out the demo video below!",
